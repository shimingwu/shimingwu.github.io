## 5V for big data
- `Volume`: The size/scale of data
- `Velocity`: The speed of input of data (like data streaming)
- `Variety`: The different structures of data. For example, images, articles...
- `Veracity`: The quality of data. 
- `Value`: The value brought by the data

Nowadays, the frequent network activities result in a huge amount of data (Volume). To process these data, big data technology is required. Furthermore, the speed to process data is important (Velocity). For example, if we cannot analyze the data obtained within certain period of time, the value of data will be lost (Value), like detecting the system error in transport system of a city. Besides, there are multiple types of data are generated (Variety). Lastly, even if the data can be processed in a huge volume fast, the quality of both data and results should be taken care of (Veracity).

## Infrastructure of big data
- `Cloud Computing`
- `Data Center`

Cloud computing serves as an infrastructure to support the big data processing and calculation. There are three main serves provided by the cloud computing:
- `IaaS`: Infrastructure as a Service. With this, the operation cost can be saved.
- `PaaS`: Platform as a Service. Users can configure certain platforms like databases.
- `SaaS`: Software as a Service. Users can directly consume the software like Gmail.

With these, everything can be provided as a service and it helps to save cost, provide 'infintie' calculating/storage capacity to users and users  can utilize these on demand. At the same, Cloud Computing also contributes a lot in terms of data generating. Thus, it is a data provider, at the same time, also a solution provider.

Data center serves as a key infrastructure of cloud computing. A data center mainly has three blocks:

- `blade server`: refer to a normal server
- `rack`: a rack consists of dozens of servers
- `data center`: a data center consists of many racks

The transfer of data is expensive especially when a data needs to be sent across the network.
